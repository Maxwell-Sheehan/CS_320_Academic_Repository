How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I think one of the best ways to ensure this is to encapsalte the code as much as possible, especially in the form of automatic tests. I tested each condition set for the software individually, not simply checking if one value wasn't eligible, but why it wasn't eligible. Also, testing new values when it's edited, or deleted ensures its secure throughout the entire process, and there's minimal areas a value could corupt my software.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

In this instance the users needs were very transparent, we had very specific parameters on what and wasn't allowed. So I shaped the testing around that in an increadibly literal form. But also the type of errors give users feedback on why something is rejected, which I think is good design. If someting is an error, good software tells you why clearly. 

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software in a very jaded, 0 trust capacity. Simply because not everyone is malicious, most people simple aren't. But errors can be catastrophic even accidently, if we don't secure software well, and handle edge casses approprietly. We don't want someone accidentlty entering a value that shouldn't exist/ updating a value to something that shouldn't exist, and it completly corrupting our database. Even if it was a purely innocent mistake, we have to take responsibilty as developers in this way.
